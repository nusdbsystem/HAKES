/** Fast scan version of IVFPQ. Works for 4-bit PQ for now.
 *
 * The codes in the inverted lists are not stored sequentially but
 * grouped in blocks of size bbs. This makes it possible to very quickly
 * compute distances with SIMD instructions.
 *
 * Implementations (implem):
 * 0: auto-select implementation (default)
 * 1: orig's search, re-implemented
 * 2: orig's search, re-ordered by invlist
 * 10: optimizer int16 search, collect results in heap, no qbs
 * 11: idem, collect results in reservoir
 * 12: optimizer int16 search, collect results in heap, uses qbs
 * 13: idem, collect results in reservoir
