# HAKES python client (Under development)

Python client of HAKES. It is intended to allows interaction with the entire HAKES system via hakes-worker and directly to individual layer and components for maximum flexibility.

It loads a config that describes a deployment of HAKES.

`Status`: Now we allow the client to directly interact search workers to issue vector search queries.
